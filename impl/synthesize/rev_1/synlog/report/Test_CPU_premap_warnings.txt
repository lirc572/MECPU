@W: MT529 :"/home/rochor/APPLICATIONS/Gowin_V1.9.2.02Beta/FPGA_Projects/Test_CPU/src/cpu.v":67:2:67:7|Found inferred clock top|clk which controls 127 sequential elements including cpu_instance.ir_addr[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
